<P CLASS="western">The following sections describe each of the major
features of <VAR>lignumCAD</VAR> in more detail.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="generated/Introduction_html_m314e4293.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=24 height=28 BORDER=0>As
of <EM>lignumCAD</EM> Version 0.2, the Sketch, Part and Assembly
capabilities have been partially implemented.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="../../graphics/sketch.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=19 height=17 BORDER=0>Sketches</H2>
<P CLASS="western">When you start a piece of furniture from scratch,
the best place to begin is by making some simple sketches. Sketches
let you define the major dimensions of the model in a series of 2D
views. My usual approach is to consider where the furniture is going
to be placed and use the dimensions of the space to determine the
overall size of the piece. Alternatively, you may have found a plan
in a magazine and want to modify its dimensions for a particular
application. The sketchbook can be used as a simple mechanical
drawing aid to resize the design.</P>
<P CLASS="western">A sketch is a simple 2D drawing. It supports
functions like most drawing programs, but with an emphasis on
engineering drawing, including automatic dimension lines, reference
lines, centerlines, and text annotation. You can define as many
sketches as desired to represent multiple views of the geometry.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="../../graphics/part.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=17 height=17 BORDER=0>Parts</H2>
<P CLASS="western">After laying out the major dimensions of the
model, you must construct solid geometry for each of the separate
parts, for example a leg or drawer front. In general, a part is
anything which can be milled from a single piece of stock. The
collection of parts which make up a model is usually called the <EM>bill
of materials</EM>, so we want to make a solid model for each item in
the bill of materials.</P>
<P CLASS="western">When you create a part, <VAR>lignumCAD</VAR> will
offer you a library of predefined solids. You can either select a
blank (such as a board or a turning) or you can select a
prefabricated shape (such as a turned knob or a tapered leg). You can
then adjust the overall size of the part to suit your model. You can
either type in the dimensions or you can import dimensions from your
sketches. Importing dimensions from the sketches reveals the power of
parametric modeling. If you are consistent in your definitions of
dimensions, then you will be able to modify the shape of the model
from any view of it; for example, change the height of a leg on a
sketch and the solid model will be recompute the size and shape of
the solid part. Conversely, if you change the length of the leg in
the solid part view, the sketch will adjust itself accordingly.</P>
<P CLASS="western">After creating the basic shape of the part, you
can apply typical woodworking &quot;milling&quot; operations to it:
taper a leg, drill a hole, or make a freehand cut. There will also be
a library of standard edge treatments which can be applied:
round-overs, chamfers, ogees.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Finally, you can assign a material to the part.
Various woods and other synthetic materials will be available. With
respect to wood, you can even assign a grain direction to the part.
In general, the material assignment is cosmetic; the program will not
do anything other display a reasonable approximation of the material
texture.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="../../graphics/assembly.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=16 height=20 BORDER=0>Assemblies</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Once you have constructed all the parts in the
bill of materials, the next step is to collect all the parts into an
assembly. For example, if you've constructed the front, sides, back
and bottom of a drawer, you can assemble them into the 3D
representation of the drawer. You then might take the (single) leg
you've defined and replicate it three times and connect them with
skirts to form another assembly. You could then collect the drawer,
the leg assembly and the top together to form the complete table
assembly. (The drawer and leg assemblies would then be properly
called sub-assemblies.)</P>
<P CLASS="western">The next step in <VAR>lignumCAD</VAR> is one that
I expect to be most useful: the Joint Wizard. Say you've created your
drawer model by simply abutting the front, sides and back. When you
build the drawer, however, you intend to use half-blind dovetails for
the front and through dovetails for the back. The joint wizard will
let you select two (adjacent) parts and define the joint which
connects them in a general way. For example, you might say, &quot;I
want a half-blind dovetail with three tails at 9&deg;.&quot;
<VAR>lignumCAD</VAR> will compute the layout of the dovetails and
automatically &quot;remove&quot; the material from the parts (i.e.,
it will recompute the solid geometry such that the parts'
mathematical representations are similar to the final jointed
pieces).</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="../../graphics/drawing.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=17 height=16 BORDER=0>Drawings</H2>
<P CLASS="western">After the assembly is defined, you have a complete
three-dimensional solid geometry model of the piece of furniture. The
next step is to create construction drawings. A construction drawing
usually consists of three orthographic (two-dimensional) views of
each part in the bill of materials with sufficient dimensions to
construct the object.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Construction drawings will look similar to the
sketches you created initially, except for the following differences:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">The relationships between parts are usually
	not shown. Each drawing is of a single part (of course, <VAR>lignumCAD</VAR>
	will let you show whatever you want).</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">In sketch mode, you cannot create redundant
	dimensions: for example, in a typical table design, you cannot
	define all three of the following simultaneously: the length of a
	leg, the thickness of the top and the overall height of the table.
	In the construction drawing, you can display each of these
	dimensions, however, one will be purely cosmetic.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">The drawing will display details of the
	geometry which are not defined in the sketch. For example, if you
	have a table skirt and a leg connected by a mortise and tenon joint,
	the actual width of the skirt part will be longer (by the length of
	the two tenons, obviously) than was shown in the sketch.</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="../../graphics/layout.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=17 height=18 BORDER=0>Layout</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Another useful feature of <VAR>lignumCAD</VAR>
will be the ability to layout the parts from the bill of materials on
a given set of stock. In theory, it can use existing stock or it can
generate an optimal set of requirements. Needless-to-say, real lumber
(and real life) are rarely so neat.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="../../graphics/render.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=18 height=21 BORDER=0>Environment
Rendering</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Sometimes it's helpful to understand the
interaction of an object with its surroundings. <VAR>lignumCAD</VAR>
will provide the ability to do high-quality three-dimensional
rendering of models and their surroundings. You can image taking a
digital photograph of the intended location of the piece and using
the images to create a &ldquo;virtual reality&rdquo; image of the
piece in place.</P>
