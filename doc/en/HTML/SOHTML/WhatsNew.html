<H1 CLASS="western">What's New</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Version 0.2</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Version 0.2 of <VAR>lignumCAD</VAR> includes the
following updates.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">New Features</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">The primary new feature of Version 0.2 is
	Assembly mode. You can now construct reasonably complete models of
	simple pieces. See the Assembly documentation for a tutorial
	example.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Many thanks to Christoph Eckert for
	contributing a German translation of the primary user interface text
	and for pointing out many (if not all) of the problems with
	<VAR>lignumCAD</VAR>'s internationalization. Also, more complete
	credits have been added to the &ldquo;About lignumCAD&rdquo; dialog.</P>
</UL>
<H3 CLASS="western">Bug Fixes</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Saving a model while a Sketch tool was active
	would cause a segmentation fault.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Using special characters (like &ldquo;/&rdquo;
	or &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;) in page names would cause a segmentation
	fault on model reload. Any character can now be used safely.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">It was possible to name two objects of the
	same type with the same name through the model hierarchy view.</P>
</UL>
<H3 CLASS="western">Warnings</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">The format of the .lcad file is changed in
	this version. It is not backwards compatible and there is no
	provision in the code to read the old format. A converter program
	would be possible, but until the code reaches a more mature state,
	maintaining backwards compatibility is not a high priority.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Starting with this release, the <VAR>lignumCAD</VAR>
	RPM will install itself in a directory named /opt/lignumCAD/v<VAR>x</VAR>.<VAR>y</VAR>
	(where x and y are the major and minor version numbers) rather than
	scattered around in /usr as in previous releases. This will allow
	you to have more than one installation of <VAR>lignumCAD</VAR>
	installed at a time (though, there probably aren't too many people
	who <EM>really</EM> want to do that). If you upgrade your <VAR>lignumCAD</VAR>
	installation in the usual way:</P>
	<PRE>$ rpm -Uvh lignumCAD-0.2-2.i386.rpm</PRE><P CLASS="western">
	the old /usr/share/lignumCAD directory will not be removed. Please
	execute a:</P>
	<PRE>$ rm -r /usr/share/lignumCAD</PRE><P CLASS="western">
	in order to clean up after the old RPMs.</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Version 0.1</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Version 0.1 of <VAR>lignumCAD</VAR> includes the
following updates.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Bug Fixes</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Activating some menu actions after loading a model
from a file would cause a segmentation fault.</P>
<P CLASS="western">There was a left-over debug statement which
(intentionally) caused a segmentation fault when undoing a dimension
relocation.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">New Features</H3>
<P CLASS="western">You can enter numeric values in decimal notation
even if the default precision is FRACTIONAL.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><VAR>lignumCAD</VAR> now uses OpenCASCADE for most
of its solid modeling capabilities.</P>
<P CLASS="western">You can now create simple solid parts and assign a
material to them. (The next version will allow you to create
assemblies of parts, resulting in a substantially more useful
program.)</P>
