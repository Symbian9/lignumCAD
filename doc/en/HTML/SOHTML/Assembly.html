<H2 CLASS="western">Create an Assembly</H2>
<P CLASS="western">In the previous section, we created the individual
parts of a table. Each part was created floating in space, without
reference to the other parts of the table. Now we will begin to
arrange the individual parts into their proper places with respect to
each other. The goal of building the assembly of parts is two-fold:
to see what the piece looks like when complete and to prepare to
create the joints which will ultimately hold the parts together.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">The Table Top</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The first assembly we will create will be the
table top. The top consists of a field and two breadboard edges. In
order to create an assembly, the parts which will comprise it must
have already been created and included in the model which we are
working on. So, open the model which you created in the previous
section; it should contain a 15 &frac12;&rdquo; x 16&rdquo; Top field
part and a 2&rdquo; x 6&rdquo; Breadboard edge part.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Create a new assembly by selecting the
<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Insert|Assembly</B></FONT> menu
option (or by selecting <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Assembly</B></FONT>
from the tab bar context menu or by clicking on the toolbar).
<VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR> will display the Create New
Assembly dialog.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/top_assembly_start.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALT="Top Assembly start dialog" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=280 height=229 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western">From this dialog, you must select a part to start
the assembly with. Click on the part named <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Top
field</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>. Also, navigate to the name type-in and
enter <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Top</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>.
Click <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>OK</B></FONT> (or press
<FONT FACE="Helmet, monospace"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #c0c0c0">Enter</SPAN></B></FONT>
or type <FONT FACE="Helmet, monospace"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #c0c0c0">Alt+O</SPAN></B></FONT>)
to accept the choices and create the assembly.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Next, we want to add a breadboard edge to the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Top</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
assembly. Select the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Tools|Add
Model</B></FONT> menu option. A dialog window similar to the Create
New Assembly dialog will appear. Select the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Breadboard
edge</SPAN></SPAN></FONT> part and click <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>OK</B></FONT>.
Turn on solid mode (press the right mouse button and select <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Solid</B></FONT>
from the context menu) and rotate the view around (press the left
mouse button and drag it up and down). You should see that both the
field and the breadboard edge are now both shown in the display. You
should see something like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/top_asm_step1.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALT="Top assembly step 1" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=404 height=344 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western">Now, we need to define the relationship between
the field and the breadboard edge. This is the purpose of the
Constraint Definition window which appears when a part is added to an
assembly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/assembly_constraint_dialog.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALT="Assembly Constraint dialog" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=135 height=554 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western">To understand how assembly constraints work is
somewhat complicated, but it quickly becomes intuitive, perhaps even
fun. Consider what you do when you physically assemble a top with a
breadboard edge: you usually cut a long tongue on the edge of the
field and a corresponding slot on the breadboard edge; the tongue is
slightly smaller than the slot. When you slip the breadboard onto the
tongue, the side of the breadboard with the slot will be <EM CLASS="western">flush</EM>
against the base of the tongue. However, there will be a certain
amount of play in the breadboard; you will still be able to move it a
little bit forward and backwards along the tongue and a little bit up
and down. Ultimately, when you drill the holes for the pins, you want
to make sure that the top of the field and the top of the breadboard
<EM CLASS="western">align</EM> and that the front of the field and
the front of the breadboard <EM CLASS="western">align</EM>. The three
faces of the breadboard which you try to line up with the field
constitute the three constraints which you will create in <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR>.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The constraint definition window has four
constraints which you can apply: <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Mate</B></FONT>,
<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Align</B></FONT>, <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Mate
Offset</B></FONT> and <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Align
Offset</B></FONT>. To summarize the basic actions: mate means that
two surfaces are stuck together facing each other, align means two
surfaces line up facing the same direction. The two offset
constraints allow for the two surfaces to be separated by a given
distance but otherwise obeying the same constraints on orientation.
Before explaining the constraints more explicitly, let's complete
placement of the first breadboard edge.</P>
<P CLASS="western">As suggested by our mechanical procedure, we will
first place the breadboard edge against the field. Click <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Mate</B></FONT>
(or type <FONT FACE="Helmet, monospace"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #c0c0c0">Alt+M</SPAN></B></FONT>)
and the cursor becomes the face selection cursor (<IMG SRC="../../graphics/create_asm_cursor.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALT="Assembly creation cursor" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=32 height=32 BORDER=0>).
In the main window, you will see that only faces of the breadboard
will be highlighted as you move the mouse over the parts. Also,
observe that only faces which actually face the front of the screen
are highlighted (in other words, if you want to select a hidden face,
you will have to rotate the view point). You want to click on one of
the long, narrow faces of the breadboard edge, as show in the figure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/top_asm_step2.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALT="Top assembly step 2" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=356 height=288 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western">(You might notice that there are actually two such
faces on the breadboard. Which should you pick? Since the breadboard
is symmetric, it really doesn't matter. Later when we work with more
complicated parts, though, there will be less choice.)</P>
<P CLASS="western">After picking the edge of the breadboard, the
cursor will change to the additional face selection cursor (<IMG SRC="../../graphics/create_asm_plus_cursor.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALT="Assembly creation plus cursor" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=32 height=32 BORDER=0>).
In the main window, now, you will only be able to select faces from
the field. Highlight one of the end grain edges of the field. (These
are the longer, 16&rdquo; edges. It might help to switch to Texture
mode, since you will be able to see the direction of the grain.) 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/top_asm_step3.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALT="Top assembly step 3" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=450 height=330 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western"><VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR> will now
calculate a new position for the breadboard such that the two
selected faces are mated. Your assembly should look like the figure
below.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/top_asm_step4.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALT="Top assembly step 4" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=310 height=276 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western">In the figure, it looks like the breadboard edge
is now properly placed. It appears that the top of the breadboard and
the top of the field align, as do the front of both parts. However,
as far as the computer is concerned, the breadboard has not been
completely constrained. This is indicated by program with the
Constraint Definition window: as long as this window is still
present, the part is not completely constrained. As with our real
breadboard, it is still possible to move the breadboard back and
forth, and up and down.</P>
<P CLASS="western">To complete placement of the breadboard, select
<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Align</B></FONT> and select the
top surface of the breadboard and the top surface of the field.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/top_asm_step5.png" NAME="Graphic9" ALT="Top assembly step 5" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=316 height=126 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Select <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Align</B></FONT>
again and select the front surface of the breadboard and the front
surface of the field. <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR> will now
hide the constraint definition window, indicating that the breadboard
has been fully constrained.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/top_asm_step6.png" NAME="Graphic10" ALT="Top assembly step 6" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=328 height=122 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western">Finish the Top by adding another breadboard edge
to the other side of the field. When complete, your Top should look
like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/top_asm_step7.png" NAME="Graphic11" ALT="Completed top assembly" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=664 height=576 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western">The following section describes the assembly
constraint process in a little more technical detail. You can skip
ahead to <A HREF="#The Table Base Section">the Table Base section</A>
if you're not interested. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Some Assembly Constraint Details</H3>
<P CLASS="western">This section attempts to describe some of the
details of assembly constraints without too much in the way of
mathematics. You should be able to use the program without completely
understanding this material, but when things get complicated, it is
always useful to understand exactly what is going on. The full
mathematics of assembly constraints are described in the Technical
Reference [<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">TBD</FONT>].</P>
<P CLASS="western">First off, recall the two-dimensional XY
<EM CLASS="western">coordinate system</EM> from algebra. A coordinate
system describes a way in which to locate positions on a
two-dimensional plane. The coordinate system consists of two number
lines at right angles to each other. Any point can be defined by a
pair of numbers, each of which denotes a position along one of the
number lines.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="generated/Assembly_html_m49bae88d.png" NAME="Object1" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=245 height=215></P>
<P CLASS="western">The proper name for a number line in a coordinate
system is <EM CLASS="western">axis</EM>. The horizontal number line
is usually called the X axis and the vertical line is usually called
the Y axis. The point where the two axes meet is usually assumed to
be the position corresponding to zero distance along each line; it is
called the <EM CLASS="western">origin</EM> of the coordinate system.
Such a coordinate system is usually called a <EM CLASS="western">Cartesian</EM>
coordinate system in honor of Ren&eacute; Decartes (1596-1650). (To
reiterate: The attributes which make this a Cartesian coordinate
system are: 1) the surface on which the coordinate system is placed
is a flat plane, 2) the axes are straight lines, 3) positions along
the axes are uniformly spaced, and 4) the axes intersect at 90&ordm;.
Many other arrangements of surface, axis curve, position spacing and
intersection angle are possible; these alternate arrangements yield
non-Cartesian coordinate systems.)</P>
<P CLASS="western">It is especially fitting to mention this here,
since Decartes' contribution to mathematics was to show how the
theorems of geometry could be translated into algebraic equivalents.
Geometry deals with abstract figures, such as points and lines.
Although we have an intuitive understanding about how such objects
relate to the real world, geometry itself does <EM CLASS="western">not</EM>
provide an explicit meaning for them<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>.
Descartes showed how such abstract entities can be described by sets
of numbers and algebraic equations; which in turn allows them to be
manipulated by a computer. Thus, <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR>,
itself, is an expression of geometry through algebra.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The next step to understanding the constraint
system of <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR> is to look at
<EM CLASS="western">coordinate system transformation</EM>. Suppose
that, instead of a simple point being specified in a coordinate
system, you were specifying the origin of another coordinate system.
Consider this figure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="generated/Assembly_html_m5dedfc4c.png" NAME="Object2" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=245 height=215></P>
<P CLASS="western">We now have two coordinate systems, conventionally
called the XY and X'Y' (pronounced &ldquo;X-prime, Y-prime&rdquo;)
coordinate systems. For concreteness, let the origin of the X'Y'
coordinate system be at the point [2&nbsp;&frac12; ,2] in the XY
coordinate system. Suppose that you had a point, A, in the X'Y'
coordinate system at [3,2]. The question to ask is: What is the
position of A in the XY coordinate system? It's simple enough to take
a ruler and measure the distance of A from the origin of the XY
coordinate system. It would turn out to be [5&nbsp;&frac12; ,4]. It
should also be clear that any point in the X'Y' coordinate system can
be converted to a point in the XY coordinate system simply by adding
the position of the X'Y' origin to it. Similarly, to convert a point
in the XY coordinate system to one in the X'Y' coordinate system, you
would simply subtract the position of the X'Y' origin.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Similarly to points, it is also possible to
consider that figures can be drawn with respect to a coordinate
system. Here is a figure of a rectangle which is drawn with respect
to a coordinate system displaced from the origin by [3,2].</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="generated/Assembly_html_m53229ede.png" NAME="Object3" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=245 height=215></P>
<P CLASS="western">How is this germane to <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR>?
Each part that you create in <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR> has
a coordinate system. In fact, each part has its own, personal (the
technical term is <EM CLASS="western">local</EM>) coordinate system.
You can imagine that each part is stuck to its local coordinate
system; where ever the coordinate system goes, the part must go to.</P>
<P CLASS="western">When you create an assembly, you somehow have to
merge the local coordinate systems of each part together. Here is a
simple figure which illustrates the process.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="generated/Assembly_html_1ba39de3.png" NAME="Object4" width=392 height=222></P>
<P CLASS="western">Each of the two rectangles in the figure have a
local coordinate system. The origin of the left rectangle's local
coordinate system is at [-5,2]; the origin of the right rectangle is
at [4,2]. When we choose to mate two parts together in an assembly,
this essentially means that we want to know where to move the origin
of the right rectangle (for example) such that the right edge of the
left rectangle (labeled A in the figure) coincides with the left edge
of the right rectangle (labeled B). For our example, algebra tells us
that the edge A is 4 units to the left from edge B. Therefore, if we
move the origin of the right rectangle's coordinate system 4 units to
the left, then the two edges will coincide. The operation of moving
the origin of a coordinate system is called <EM CLASS="western">translation</EM>.</P>
<P CLASS="western">There is another aspect of assembly constraints to
understand from our example mate operation: the translation of the
right rectangle's origin only moved it the direction of the X axis.
It did not determine if there should have been a translation in the Y
axis direction. The reason for this is the nature of the entity which
determined the translation: the line segments A and B. The edges of
the rectangles are composed of line segments; where lines are
one-dimensional objects which continue without a definite beginning
or end, line segments are generally a finite section of a line with
definite boundary points. It is straight forward to compute the
distance between two lines (as long as they are parallel, of course)
and translate them so that they coincide. However, how do you line up
the ends of the line segments? A single constraint is not sufficient
to completely determine the relationship between line segments. Thus,
you would need an additional constraint  to, for example, align both
top edges of the rectangles: This would give you a translation in the
Y direction and complete the constraint.</P>
<P CLASS="western">In addition to translation, another form of
coordinate system transformation is <EM CLASS="western">rotation</EM>.
The figure shows a coordinate system, X'Y' , which is rotated about
its own origin (which is, itself, translated from the origin of the
XY coordinate system). Again, it is possible to write an equation
which converts a point in the X'Y' coordinate system into a
corresponding point in the XY coordinate system. The equations
involved are more complicated than in the case of translation, but
ultimately, there is a straight-forward way to represent both
operations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="generated/Assembly_html_7d161853.png" NAME="Object5" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=255 height=215></P>
<P CLASS="western">How do rotations arise in <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR>?
The figure below shows the initial step of an assembly of a table
skirt and a table leg. As you can see, the orientation of the table
leg is not initially correct. If the first operation is to mate the
right side of the skirt to the flat on the side of the table leg,
then the coordinate system of the table leg will need to be rotated
90&ordm; before the appropriate faces can be translated to coincide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="generated/Assembly_html_m4d2209e3.png" NAME="Object9" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=393 height=187></P>
<P CLASS="western"><VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR>, of course,
works in three dimensions. A three-dimensional coordinate system is
shown in the figure below. There are three axes, X, Y and Z, and each
makes a right angle with the other two. In addition, the Z axis obeys
the &ldquo;Right Hand Rule&rdquo; (i.e., if you point the figures of
your right hand along the X axis and curl them in toward the Y axis,
your thumb will point in the Z axis direction). Such a coordinate
system is usually called a right-handed coordinate system.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="generated/Assembly_html_m705f05f5.png" NAME="Object6" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=255 height=215></P>
<P CLASS="western">The same arguments which apply to transforming
line segments to coincide also apply to faces of solids in three
dimensions. In particular, the bounded planes which make up the most
common faces behave almost identically to line segments. However,
since plane faces are two-dimensional instead of one-dimensional, a
third constraint is needed to fully specify the location of assembled
part. Let's consider an example and pick up some more jargon along
the way: Suppose that you have two square blocks, one which has 2&rdquo;
edges and another which has 1&rdquo; edges. The goal is to completely
constrain the 1&rdquo; block with respect to the 2&rdquo; block.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The first question to answer is: How am I allowed
to move the 1&rdquo; block, or, more precisely, how am I allowed to
move the coordinate system of the 1&rdquo; block? This question is
difficult to answer precisely without mathematics, but we'll give it
a try. The first concept to tackle goes by the name of <EM CLASS="western">linear
independence</EM>. In this context, linear independence means that
there is only one way to move an object in a given direction. For
example, if you want to move an object along the X axis of the global
coordinate system, this can only be accomplished by translating its
local coordinate system along the X axis. It could not be
accomplished by translating its coordinate system just along the Y
axis or just along the Z axis or <EM CLASS="western">any combination
of translations</EM> along the Y and Z axis. In other words,
translations in the X direction are independent of translations in
the Y and Z directions. The same thing holds true for translations
along either the Y or Z axes as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Suppose you want to translate the block 1 &frac12;&rdquo;
along a 45&ordm; line between the X and Y axes? Such a translation
would consist of a combination of translations along both axes. A
subtle consequence of linear independence, however, insures that this
combination is unique. That is, there is only  one possible
combination of translations which can move the coordinate system to
the desired position.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Some more jargon: The fact that, in
three-dimensional geometry, there are three linearly independent
directions means that the system has three <EM CLASS="western">degrees
of freedom</EM>. But, there is more to it. Just like the rotation
operation in two dimensions, you can rotate a coordinate system in
three dimensions as well. In three dimensions, however, there are
three &ldquo;directions&rdquo; in which a coordinate system may be
rotated. In the figure below, a second three-dimensional coordinate
system is shown. The best way to think of rotating a
three-dimensional coordinate system is to imagine the Z axis piercing
a sphere centered around the origin of the transformed coordinate
system.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="generated/Assembly_html_4665f4bd.png" NAME="Object8" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=255 height=215></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Just like the coordinates of latitude
and longitude are used to locate a point on the surface of the Earth,
you need two coordinates to define the direction of the Z axis.
Additionally, you can now imagine another rotation of the system
shown above: that of twisting the X'Y' axes around the Z' axis (which
is exactly equivalent to the rotation of the two-dimensional
coordinate system). Therefore, in addition to the three degrees of
translational freedom, a three-dimensional coordinate system also has
three degrees of rotational freedom.</P>
<P CLASS="western">So, getting back to the block example, pick a face
on the 1&rdquo; block and a face on the 2&rdquo; block and place them
touching each other. This is equivalent to the mate constraint in
<VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR>. Now, how can you move the 1&rdquo;
block so that the two faces remain touching? You can move the 1&rdquo;
block up and down, and forwards and backwards; you can also twist the
block around. Therefore, the mate operation has specified three of
our six degrees of freedom, namely one translational direction and
two of the rotational directions.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The next constraint to apply is to say that the
front faces of both blocks will be flush with one another. So, twist
the 1&rdquo; block around until its front face is pointing in the
same direction as the 2&rdquo; block's front face and slide it so
that the two faces line up. Now, how can you move the 1&rdquo; block
so that it still meets both of the constraints we've created? Its
left face must remain in contact with the right face of the 2&rdquo;
block and its front face must remain aligned with the front face of
the 2&rdquo; block. The only remaining degree of freedom for the 1&rdquo;
block is to slide up and down; the align constraint has specified one
more translational and the remaining rotational degree of freedom.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The last constraint is aligning the top of the 1&rdquo;
block with the top of the 2&rdquo; block. This consumes the last
degree of translational freedom and thus fully constrains the
position of the 1&rdquo; block.</P>
<P CLASS="western">You might ask why the mate and align operations
are chosen as they are. You can imagine different methods of evolving
constraints, some probably easier than this scheme. The answer is
that this system <EM CLASS="western">is</EM> wholly arbitrary. If you
want to suggest improvements, we're always willing to listen.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="The Table Base Section"></A>The Table
Base</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Constructing the table base is essentially the
same as assembling the top. It is somewhat more complicated because
there are more parts and the parts themselves are slightly more
complicated. Start by creating a new assembly named <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Base</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
using the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Front
Skirt</SPAN></SPAN></FONT> part. Now you want to add a <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Leg</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
part to the assembly. The constraint dialog will activate and you
should see something like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/base_asm_step1.png" NAME="Graphic12" ALT="Base assembly step 1" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=308 height=306 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Note that the leg is tapered on two
sides. This is an aesthetic consideration and you could certainly
make a leg however you'd like. As of version 0.2 of <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR>,
though, you're stuck with this kind of leg. In addition to the two
sided taper, it is conventional to put the tapered edge on the inside
of the piece. Notice, then, that there are two faces of the leg which
form small rectangles at the top of the leg. In order to make the
table base, you will need to mate these faces to the edges of the
skirts. Assuming that we're starting with the right, front leg of the
table, select the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Mate</B></FONT>
operation and pick the face of the leg shown below.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/base_asm_step2.png" NAME="Graphic13" ALT="Base assembly step 2" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=274 height=282 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Note that I have spun the window around
to the back side so that the two leg flats are facing out from the
screen. In this orientation, you want to select the flat on the right
side of the leg. Next, pick the closer edge of the skirt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/base_asm_step3.png" NAME="Graphic14" ALT="Base assembly step 4" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=298 height=314 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>After you select the skirt edge,
<VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR> will apply the constraint and
compute the new position of the leg. It will actually look kind of
strange,</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>but remember, we still have a
rotational degree of freedom left. The next step, then, is to align
the top of the leg with the stop of the skirt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/base_asm_step5.png" NAME="Graphic16" ALT="Base assembly step 5" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=690 height=312 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>The final touch is to align the front
of the leg with the front of the skirt. Again, an aesthetic
consideration is that the leg should not be flush with the skirt;
rather, it should be slightly proud of the skirt in order to make a
more interesting shadow line. To accomplish this, we will make an
Align Offset constraint of the part fronts. So select Align Offset
and select the faces shown below.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/base_asm_step6.png" NAME="Graphic17" ALT="Base assembly step 6" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=472 height=366 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>After you select the front face of the
skirt, the offset dialog will be shown. Enter a value of 1/8&rdquo;.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/base_asm_step7.png" NAME="Graphic18" ALT="Base assembly step 7 (offset dialog)" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=280 height=149 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>The leg is now completely constrained
and the constraint dialog should hide itself. If you click on the
leg, it will be activated and you will see a dimension for the align
offset. If you want to change the offset, you can double click on the
dimension and the offset dialog will be displayed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/base_asm_step8.png" NAME="Graphic19" ALT="Base assembly step 8" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=282 height=290 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>The next step is up to you. You can
either add a leg to the other side of the front skirt or add the side
skirt to the right front leg. The procedure is the same as before:
add the part, mate the part to the assembly, align the top with the
assembly and add an align offset to set the skirt back. When
complete, your table base should look like the figure below.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/base_asm_stepL.png" NAME="Graphic20" ALT="Final base assembly" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=282 height=398 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="generated/Assembly_html_m314e4293.png" NAME="Graphic21" ALT="A light bulb" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=22 height=26 BORDER=0>When
you add a skirt to the assembly, you will mate it to a leg, align it
to the top of the leg and the align offset the skirt from the leg.
Because the skirt is recessed relative to the leg, when the offset
dialog appears, enter <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">-1/8&rdquo;</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">The Grand Assembly</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Besides gluing parts together in an assembly, you
can also assemble Assemblies. So, to complete the table we are going
to put together the top and base. Create a new assembly named <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Table</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
and start it with the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Table
Base</SPAN></SPAN></FONT> assembly. Then add the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Top</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
assembly. Your table assembly should look like the figure below.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/table_asm_step1.png" NAME="Graphic22" ALT="Table assembly step 1" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=390 height=346 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western">Mate the bottom of the top to one of the top
surfaces of the base. Note that there is a lot of ambiguity in these
directions. For example, the bottom of the top could refer to any of
six faces in the top assembly: the top or bottom of the field or the
top or bottom of either of the two breadboard edges. Since they are
all in the same plane, the top will be in the same final position
regardless of the selection. However, you want to think about what it
means to mate the top to the base, which will generally mean the
bottom of the field will rest on the base. Similarly, the top of the
base could be represented by any of the either top faces in the base
assembly: the tops of the four legs or the tops of the four skirts.
The choice is less clear here; the top of the front skirt is probably
the best choice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/table_asm_step2.png" NAME="Graphic23" ALT="Table assembly step 2" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=388 height=322 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western">Now we need to center the top on the base. The
correct way to do this would be to use the centerline we created on
our original sketch of the table. However, the version 0.2 of
<VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR> does not yet allow propagation
of dimensions between pages, so we have to compute the correct values
ourselves. Recall that the top section of the legs are 1 &frac12;&rdquo;
thick and the side skirts are 9 &frac12;&rdquo; long. Therefore, the
depth of the base between the from and rear legs is
2&nbsp;*&nbsp;1.5&rdquo;&nbsp;+&nbsp;9.5&rdquo;&nbsp;=&nbsp;12.5&rdquo;.
Also, the front and rear skirts are set back by 1/8&rdquo; from the
face of each leg, so the distance between the outer faces of the
front and rear skirts is 12.5&rdquo;&nbsp;-2&nbsp;*&nbsp;1/8&rdquo;&nbsp;=&nbsp;12
&frac14;&rdquo;. The top is 16&rdquo; deep, to the front edge of the
top must be offset by (16&rdquo;&nbsp;-12&nbsp;&frac14;&rdquo;)&nbsp;/&nbsp;2&nbsp;=1&nbsp;7/8&rdquo;.
Create an align offset constraint and select the front edge of the
top assembly and the front face of the front skirt. The figure below
shows one possible set of choices. Enter <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">1&nbsp;7/8&rdquo;</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
in the offset dialog.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/table_asm_step3.png" NAME="Graphic25" ALT="Table assembly step 3" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=460 height=386 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western">The front and rear skirts of the base are 13&rdquo;
wide, so the width of the base is 2&nbsp;*&nbsp;1.5&rdquo;&nbsp;+&nbsp;13&rdquo;&nbsp;=&nbsp;16&rdquo;.
Again, the skirts are set back from the leg faces by 1/8&rdquo; so
the distance between the outer faces of the side skirts is
16&rdquo;&nbsp;-&nbsp;2&nbsp;*&nbsp;1/8&rdquo;&nbsp;=&nbsp;15&nbsp;&frac34;&rdquo;.
The top is 19&nbsp;&frac12;&rdquo; wide (the 15&nbsp;&frac12;&rdquo;
field plus two 2&rdquo; wide breadboard edges), so the the side edge
of the top should be offset from the side skirt by
(19&nbsp;&frac12;&rdquo;&nbsp;-&nbsp;15&nbsp;&frac34;&rdquo;)&nbsp;/&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;7/8&rdquo;.
Create another offset align constraint and select either edge of the
top assembly and one of the side skirts to complete the top
placement. The figure below shows one possible set of choices. Enter
<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">1&nbsp;7/8&rdquo;</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
in the offset dialog. (Note that while these calculations are simple,
the whole point of the computer is to eliminate this kind of tedium.
Hopefully, a future version of <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR>
will be able to do all this for you.)</P>
