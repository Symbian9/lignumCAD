<H2 CLASS="western">Creating a Sketch</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The first sketch we're going to make of the table
is its <VAR CLASS="western">plan</VAR> view. A plan view is usually
made as though we were looking down on the object from above. Of
course, terms like &quot;down&quot; and &quot;above&quot; are totally
arbitrary in mechanical drawing. In general they mean what you'd
expect them to, but to give them a more concrete definition, a plan
view (also called the <VAR CLASS="western">top</VAR> view) is the
view of an object in the first octant of a three-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate system as seen when looking in the direction of
the negative Z axis. Additionally, the direction of gravitational
attraction is taken be in the negative Z axis direction. The figure
below shows the projection of the top of the object on the sketch
plane.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="generated/Sketch_html_m69d82071.png" NAME="Object1" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=347 height=328></P>
<P CLASS="western">Our plan view is going to be very simple. We're
only going to draw the outline of the top of the table. To do this,
go to the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Tools</B></FONT> menu
and select <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Rectangle</B></FONT>.
When you move the mouse cursor into the main graphics display window,
you'll see that it has an indication that we're in rectangle creation
mode (<IMG SRC="../../graphics/create_rect_cursor.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALT="Create rectangle cursor" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=32 height=32 BORDER=0>).
Create the rectangle by pressing the left mouse button when the mouse
is in the main graphics display window and dragging the mouse (with
the button held down) until the rectangle is <EM CLASS="western">approximately</EM>
20&quot; by 20&quot; square and then release the left mouse button.
You should have something similar to the figure below.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/rectangle.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALT="Rectangle sketch" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=498 height=534 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western">Although this operation is simple, there a few
things to observe:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">When you enter rectangle creation mode, the
	user interface status area of the status line indicates the mode
	with the text &quot;Construct Rectangle&quot;. Both the cursor and
	the user interface status area return to normal after the rectangle
	is complete.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">As you drag out the rectangle, dimension
	lines are drawn to indicate its current size. Do not be concerned
	about creating a rectangle which is exactly 20&quot; by 20&quot;. It
	is very easy to adjust the size of a rectangle after it is created.
	Similarly, do not be concerned about the grid lines on the sketch.
	The actual position of the rectangle on the page is unimportant.
	(The grid lines will be more useful when there are objects other
	than rectangles to create.)</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">After releasing the mouse button, the
	rectangle is activated. In this state, the rectangle is drawn with
	highlighted edges and eight resize handles. (They're supposed to
	look like little blocks of wood.) Hover the mouse cursor over each
	block and the cursor will change to indicate the direction in which
	the rectangle can be resized. Press and hold the left mouse button
	over a resize handle and you can reshape the rectangle. Clicking
	(away from a resize handle) and dragging an edge will cause the
	rectangle to move. If you click somewhere in the window but not on
	the rectangle itself, the rectangle will be deactivated. Here is a
	short table of cursor types and their meaning.</P>

	These choices select the default drawing style for geometry on the

<P CLASS="western">The final size of our top is actually 19&nbsp;&frac12;&quot;

dimension at the top of the rectangle. You will notice that the
dimension value, the dimension's  arrows and its extension lines will
be highlighted. Additionally, two square, translucent resize handles
will be highlighted. Because the dimension has not been activated
yet, the resize handles are not active yet. Double click on the
dimension; this will bring up the dimension information dialog.</P>

<P CLASS="western">This dialog shows us all the detail of the

that is, it is the dimension between the two edges of the rectangle,
<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">x0</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
and <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">x1</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>.

<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western">[There are a number of shortcomings
exposed by this dialog. Chiefly, <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">x1</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
is not the name of the dimension. Dimensions actually don't have
names. If you change this name, you will change the name of the
corresponding edge of the rectangle. Also, the Imported dimension
size is currently not available, so each dimension is a stand-alone
entity. In other words, you can't make parametric relations between
dimension's yet. A later version of <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR>
will incorporate a better distinction between dimensions (and
constraints, in general) and the objects which refer to them.]</P>
<P CLASS="western">Adjust the specified offset to 19&nbsp;&frac12;&quot;.
You can do this by clicking the arrow buttons in the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Specified</B></FONT>

dimension, you must type <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">19b1/2</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
(that is, literally, &quot;<FONT FACE="Helmet, monospace"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #c0c0c0">1</SPAN></B></FONT>&quot;

Apply your change by pressing <FONT FACE="Helmet, monospace"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #c0c0c0">Enter</SPAN></B></FONT>
(or clicking <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>OK</B></FONT>).</P>
<P CLASS="western">Modify the height dimension to 16&quot; in the
same way.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Next, double click on the rectangle itself. This
will bring up the rectangle's information dialog.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/top_rectangle_dialog.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALT="Top Rectangle dialog" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=509 height=544 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western">There is a lot to see here (and a rectangle seems
so simple!). You can see the dimension values which we changed
earlier. You can also see where the origin of the rectangle is
located (in this case at the Cartesian coordinate (12&nbsp;5/8&quot;,
23&nbsp;1/8&quot;)). The dimensions are on the Above/Right sides of
the rectangle and the rectangle is drawn in the default style. For
now, we just want to change the name of the rectangle to <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Top</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>.
So, navigate to the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Name</B></FONT>
field (try pressing <FONT FACE="Helmet, monospace"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #c0c0c0">Alt+N</SPAN></B></FONT>),
type in <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Top</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
and press <FONT FACE="Helmet, monospace"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #c0c0c0">Enter</SPAN></B></FONT>
(or click <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>OK</B></FONT>) to
apply the change.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Next, we want to add a text message to the page to
serve as a reminder of what this object is. Select the
<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Tools|Annotation</B></FONT>
menu option. The mouse cursor will become the create annotation
cursor (<IMG SRC="../../graphics/create_annotation_cursor.png" NAME="Graphic29" ALT="Annotation creation cursor" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=32 height=32 BORDER=0>).
Click and drag out a small box below the top's rectangle. When you
release the mouse, the annotation information dialog will appear.
Navigate to the main text box and enter <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Top</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>.
The annotation information dialog will let you modify the style of
the text if you choose.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/annotation_dialog.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALT="Annotation dialog" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=280 height=223 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Applying the text styles works in the
usual way. If you select some text and then change the property
widgets (e.g., click <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Bold</B></FONT>),
the new properties will be assigned to the text. If no text is
selected and you change a property, then any subsequent typed text
will have that property. To complete the annotation, click <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>OK</B></FONT>
or press <FONT FACE="Helmet, monospace"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #c0c0c0">Alt+O</SPAN></B></FONT>
(this is one of the places where just pressing <FONT FACE="Helmet, monospace"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #c0c0c0">Enter</SPAN></B></FONT>
will not dismiss the dialog). If you made your annotation box too
small, you can resize it with the resize handles. You can also click
anywhere inside the annotation to drag it around.</P>
<P CLASS="western">So, we've completed the creation of the plan view
of our table. Now would be a good time to save the model. You can
either select the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>File|Save</B></FONT>
menu option, click the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Save</B></FONT>
tool button, or press <FONT FACE="Helmet, monospace"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #c0c0c0">Ctrl+S</SPAN></B></FONT>.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Next, we want to work on the front view of the
table. This is usually called an <EM CLASS="western">elevation</EM>.
To create a new Sketch, you can can do one of three things:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Select the menu option <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Insert|Sketch</B></FONT>.
	I'd call this the <EM CLASS="western">usual way</EM>.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Use the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Insert
	Sketch</B></FONT> button on the toolbar: 
	<IMG SRC="../../graphics/insert_sketch_toolbar.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALT="Insert Sketch toolbar" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE width=162 height=60 BORDER=0>.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Use the context menu on the tab bar (press

	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/tabbar_context_menu.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALT="Tabbar Context menu" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=139 height=160 BORDER=0></P>
</OL>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Note that from the menu tab bar context
menu, you can create a new page of any type. You can also rename the
page and delete a page. Note that both the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Rename
Page</B></FONT> and the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Delete
Page</B></FONT> options apply to the currently displayed page, <EM CLASS="western">not</EM>
the one whose tab might have happened to be under mouse when the menu
was invoked. These options are also available from the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Edit</B></FONT>
menu.</P>
<P CLASS="western">After you create the new Sketch, name it <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Front

<P CLASS="western">On the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Front

and set its name to <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Top</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>.
The is the side view of the table top. <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">[In a

<P CLASS="western">Next, we want to create a rectangle for the left
leg for the table. In creating the rectangle, we want to take several
criteria into account. First, the top of the leg should be flush with
the bottom edge of the top. Second, we want the left edge of the left
leg to be offset from the left edge of the top. These requirements
are called <VAR CLASS="western">constraints</VAR> in <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR>.
The program can describe both of these constraints. To create such a
constrained rectangle, activate the Rectangle tool and position the
mouse cursor along the bottom edge of the top and near the left side.
The bottom edge of the top should be highlighted: it will be colored
a brighter color than the rest of the rectangle and translucent
resize handles will appear at the ends of the edge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/leg_start_rectangle.png" NAME="Graphic16" ALT="Leg rectangle start constraint" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=170 height=196 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Press the left mouse button and drag
out the rectangle. <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR> will now
create three dimensions for the rectangle: the width, the height and
the offset from the left edge.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Again, very simple, but there are a few
observations to make:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>The top edge of the leg is now
	<VAR CLASS="western">coincident</VAR> with the bottom edge of the
	top. This is indicated by the row of green and magenta arrows. The
	magenta arrows point to the primary edge (that is, the edge which is
	constrained; namely, the top edge of the leg); the green arrows
	point to the secondary edge (that is, the edge to which the primary
	edge is constrained; namely, the bottom edge of the top). This
	constraint has the effect that what ever position the bottom edge of
	the top has, so too will the top edge of the leg.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>The left edge of the leg is now
	<VAR CLASS="western">offset</VAR> from the left edge of the top. (In
	the program, this is called an offset constraint.) If you hover the
	mouse over the dimension, you will see that it, too, has a magenta
	arrow and a green arrow. As in the coincident constraint, the
	magenta arrow points to the primary edge and the green arrow points
	to the secondary edge. In this case, if the left edge of the top is
	moved, the left edge of the leg will move along with, always
	separated by the dimensioned offset.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>There are no resize handles along
	the top edge of the leg. Once an edge is made coincident, it is not
	possible to move it independently of its secondary reference. (Note
	that there is an option to delete constraints if necessary.)</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>When you created the left leg, you
probably ended up with some overlap between the offset dimension and
the width dimension. You can modify the position of the dimension
line by activating the dimension, and then dragging it. In the case
of the figure above, the 2&rdquo; width dimension was adjusted to a
higher position than it initially had. You also have some additional
control over the dimension positioning. In the dimension information
and rectangle information dialogs, you can choose the side of the
reference on which the dimension is to appear. In the case of
rectangles, the width dimension can appear above or below the
rectangle and the height dimension can appear either to the left or
to the right of the rectangle. An individual dimension can also
appear above or below its references.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Complete the left leg by bringing up
the rectangle information dialog and naming the rectangle <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Left
Leg</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>, setting its size to 1&nbsp;&frac12;&rdquo;
by 26&rdquo;and shifting the width dimension to the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Below</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
position. Double click on the offset dimension and set its size to
1&nbsp;&frac34;&rdquo; and the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Below</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
position.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>To create the right leg, we could
follow the same procedure, but instead, we'll take a slightly
different tack. First, create a rectangle in roughly the position of
the right leg. Don't try to create the coincident constraint when you
create the rectangle; that is, make sure the bottom edge of the top
is <EM CLASS="western">not</EM> highlighted when you press the mouse
button to start the rectangle. Next, we will create the coincident
constraint by grabbing the top resize handle of the right leg (i.e.,
position the mouse cursor over the handle so that it becomes the
vertical resize shape and pressing the left mouse button). Holding
down the mouse button, move the mouse until the cursor is over the
bottom edge of the top. The bottom edge of the top will highlight
when the mouse is in the right place. As you drag the mouse, the
right leg rectangle will resize itself; however, when you release the
mouse button, the right leg rectangle will snap to the bottom edge of
the top and a coincident constraint will be created. Note the order
of this operation: the dragged edge becomes the primary constraint
object and the highlighted edge becomes the secondary constraint
object.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>To create the offset from the right
edge of the top, select the menu option <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Tools|Dimension</B></FONT>.
The mouse cursor will become the create dimension shape (<IMG SRC="../../graphics/create_dimension_cursor.png" NAME="Graphic17" ALT="Create Dimension cursor" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=32 height=32 BORDER=0>).
Start by highlighting and clicking on the right edge of the right leg
rectangle. The cursor will then become the &ldquo;add another edge&rdquo;
shape, (<IMG SRC="../../graphics/create_dimension_plus_cursor.png" NAME="Graphic18" ALT="Dimension constraint add cursor" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=32 height=32 BORDER=0>).
Now highlight and click on the right edge of the top.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Complete the right leg by bringing up
the rectangle information dialog and naming the rectangle <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Right
Leg</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>, setting its size to 1&nbsp;&frac12;&rdquo;
by 26&rdquo; and shifting the width dimension to the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Below</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
position. Double click on the offset dimension and set its size to
1&nbsp;&frac34;&rdquo; and the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Below</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
position.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>The last piece of geometry we will add
to our elevation view is a skirt. What are the criteria for the
skirt? It should be flush with the bottom of the top and the inside
edges of both legs. We could make the appropriate constraints as the
rectangle is constructed or by dragging its edges afterwards;
however, we take another slightly different tack again. Create a
rectangle under the top and between the left and right leg but
without coincident constraints. Pick the menu option <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Tools|Alignment</B></FONT>;
the mouse cursor will become the create alignment shape (<IMG SRC="../../graphics/create_alignment_cursor.png" NAME="Graphic19" ALT="Alignment constraint cursor" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=32 height=32 BORDER=0>).
Highlight the left edge of the skirt and click the mouse button. The
cursor will become the &ldquo;add another edge&rdquo; shape (<IMG SRC="../../graphics/create_alignment_plus_cursor.png" NAME="Graphic20" ALT="Alignment constraint add cursor" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=32 height=32 BORDER=0>).
Click on the right edge of the left leg and <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR>
will create a coincident constraint between the left edge of the
skirt and the right edge of the left leg. Do similar actions to
constrain the top edge of the skirt to the bottom edge of the top and
the right edge of the skirt to the left edge of the right leg. Open
the rectangle information dialog for the skirt rectangle and name it
<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Skirt</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
and set its height to 5&nbsp;&frac12;&rdquo;. Also, adjust the height
dimension so that it is &ldquo;inside&rdquo; the skirt. Your
elevation view should now look like the figure below (with the skirt
activated).</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/table_elevation_1.png" NAME="Graphic21" ALT="First cut at table elevation" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=608 height=696 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>This could complete our work on the
table sketches, however, there are a few aspects which are not
optimal. For example, ordinarily, we would expect both table legs to
be the same length. As we created the legs, we explicitly assigned
the same length to both leg rectangles. However, if we wanted to
change the height of the table, we would have to remember to change
the height of both legs. While this is obvious for this simple model,
its easy to create a model where it's not so clear. As a first
attempt to repair this deficiency, could simply align the bottom of
one leg to the other. So, for example, activate the right leg, grab
the resize handle in the middle of the bottom edge and move the mouse
so that the cursor highlights the bottom edge of the left leg. Note
that nothing will change (substantially) on the right leg until you
release the mouse. At that point, the height dimension of the right
leg will disappear and the bottom edge will be made coincident with
the bottom of the left leg.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/leg_constaint_1.png" NAME="Graphic22" ALT="First cut at leg constraints" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=564 height=138 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Now there is only one dimension which
controls the length of the legs. For example, change the height of
the left leg to 23&rdquo; and both legs will be shortened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>While this arrangement is more
convenient, it is still not exactly what we want. What is really of
interest is the height of the table itself, not the length of the
legs. Thus, what we need is an indirect way to specify the length of
the legs relative to the overall height of the table. This is purpose
of reference lines.</P>
<P CLASS="western">To introduce reference lines, we will create a
&ldquo;floor&rdquo; for the sketch. Select the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Tools|Reference
Line</B></FONT> menu option. The cursor will become the create
reference line cursor (<IMG SRC="../../graphics/create_refline_cursor.png" NAME="Graphic23" ALT="Reference line creation cursor" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=32 height=32 BORDER=0>).
Move the mouse to just below the bottom edge of the legs and press
the mouse button but don't release it just yet.  If you drag the
mouse a short distance, you will see that it becomes the rotation
cursor (<IMG SRC="../../graphics/rotate_line_cursor.png" NAME="Graphic24" ALT="Rotate line cursor" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=32 height=32 BORDER=0>).
Reference lines can be either horizontal or vertical; drag the mouse
up and down and left and right to see the different orientations of
the reference line. Release the mouse button when the reference line
is horizontal. (The default is to create horizontal reference lines,
so really all you have to do is click and release the left mouse
button.) Double click on the reference line to bring up its
information dialog and rename the reference line to <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Floor</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Before we create the constraints from the legs to
the &ldquo;floor,&rdquo; we need to delete the coincident constraint
between the bottom of the right leg and the bottom of the left leg.
Select the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Tools|Delete
Constraint</B></FONT> menu option; the cursor becomes the delete
constraint cursor (<IMG SRC="../../graphics/delete_constraint_cursor.png" NAME="Graphic25" ALT="Delete constaint cursor" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=32 height=32 BORDER=0>).
Highlight the bottom edge of the right leg and click the left mouse
button. The coincident constraint will be removed.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Next, drag the bottom edges of both legs to be
coincident with the &ldquo;floor.&rdquo; Then, create a dimension
<EM CLASS="western">from</EM> the top edge of the top <EM CLASS="western">to</EM>
the floor (i.e., select <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Tools|Dimension</B></FONT>,
and then pick the top edge of the top and then pick the reference
line). Set the height of the table to 27&rdquo;. Our front elevation
should now look like the following figure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/table_elevation_2.png" NAME="Graphic26" ALT="Second cut at table elevation" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=648 height=705 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western">[You might wonder now how helpful this
version of our sketch is. After all, when you go to mill the legs,
you do have to know their true length. Later, when we create
construction drawings, we'll be able to recover the exact dimensions
of the legs. (In fact, if you bring up the rectangle information
dialog for the legs, you'll see that they have a height of 26 &frac14;&rdquo;.)
In general, the goal of Sketch pages should be to create the
important dimensions and relations of the parts of the model. The
details will be worked out on later pages.]</P>
<P CLASS="western">Consider that aesthetics generally favors symmetry
in a design (as a counter-example, perhaps, see
<A HREF="http://www.nakashimafoundation.org/">www.nakashimafoundation.org</A>).
In order to describe symmetry, <VAR CLASS="western">lignumCAD</VAR>
supports a <VAR CLASS="western">centerline</VAR> notation. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Select the <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Tools|Centerline</B></FONT>
menu option and the mouse cursor becomes the centerline cursor (<IMG SRC="../../graphics/create_ctrline_cursor.png" NAME="Graphic27" ALT="Centerline creation cursor" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=32 height=32 BORDER=0>).
Click somewhere between the vertical edges of the top to create a
vertical centerline. (Note that you can rotate a centerline like a
reference line if you want a horizontal centerline.) Next you want to
create a <VAR CLASS="western">centered</VAR> constraint. You do this
by selecting <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Tools|Dimension</B></FONT>
and clicking first on the centerline. Now you need to select two
edges to be centered about the centerline. Select the two vertical
edges of the top. Your page should now look like the figure below. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/table_elevation_3.png" NAME="Graphic28" ALT="Third cut at table elevation" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=634 height=712 BORDER=0></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>(When you create a centered constraint,
the dimension lines tend to be jumbled somewhat together. If you grab
a dimension by its value (i.e., by the number text), you can drag the
value from side to side as well as up and down.)</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>Now, you can adjust either the width or
the half-width of the top and the entire table will remain centered
on the centerline. Note that this is not especially meaningful for
such a simple model; however, centerlines do become more useful in
complicated models.</P>
<P CLASS="western">As the last step of creating the Sketches, we want
to print our work. Indeed, if the project is very simple, this may be
all that we really need to do. Before printing, however, we need to
set up some configuration information. Select the menu option
<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Edit|Preferences</B></FONT>;
this will invoke the application default preferences dialog.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../graphics/preferences_dialog.png" NAME="Graphic9" ALT="Preferences dialog" ALIGN=BOTTOM width=618 height=496 BORDER=0></P>

fields with suitable values for yourself. Note that for the logo,
which is optional, you can use either a raster image file or a
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file as the logo. Both types of files
will be scaled to fit in a box along with the name and location

you can usually select the printer and paper size. Note that your

the user interface. In particular, the absolute spatial position of
