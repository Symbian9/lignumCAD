<blockquote>
<blockquote>"In instrumental drawing, as in all phases of his professional
  development, the engineer should strive to achieve a high degree of knowledge
  and skill, working on his own to fill the unavoidable gaps in his formal
 education. Standards of quality and accuracy should be as high as possible,
 commensurate with the nature of the assignment and the time allowed for
its  completion. Unskilled and indifferent work on the drawing board is unworthy
 of either the aspiring or practicing engineer."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"One might as well inquire, is it worth the time required to
put on a clean shirt, to have the suit pressed and the shoes shined, or to
brush the hair?"</blockquote>

<UL>
	<LI><P>A notebook metaphor where each page is a view
	of an aspect of the design.</P>
	<LI><P>A sketching mode which allows rapid
	development of different views of a piece.</P>
	<LI><P>2D and 3D representations can be created from
	a single solid geometry model.</P>
	<LI><P>Parametric relations between dimensions allow
	changes to be propagated from either the 3D solid model, 2D drawing
	representations or sketch views.</P>
	<LI><P>Joint Wizard for easily creating joints based
	on standard woodworking techniques.</P>
	<LI><P>Extensive library of easily applied molding
	and edge treatments.</P>
	<LI><P>Visualization of final design using realistic
	material and environment details.</P>
	<LI><P>Optimal layout of bill of materials on
	existing or recommended stock.</P>
	<LI><P>Full API access via a scripting language to
