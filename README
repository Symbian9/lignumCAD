lignumCAD Version 0.2

lignumCAD is a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) program geared specifically
to aid the woodworker in designing custom furniture and other
hand-made objects. It supports both two-dimensional and
three-dimensional representations of the design with full parametric
interrelations.  Additional features include optimized layout of the
bill of materials on custom stock and photo-realistic rendering of the
final design.

This is version 0.2; there is still a long way to go. Currently, the
two-dimensional sketching mode is useful. You can also make simple
solids from the template library and assemble them into
assemblies. However, don't try to do serious work with it
yet. Never-the-less, all feedback is welcome. Please send all comments
and suggestions to lignumcad@lignumcomputing.com.

The software is available from http://sourceforge.net/project/lignumcad.

The documentation starts at ./doc/index.html (or, if you've installed
the binary, you can access the Help|Contents menu option).
